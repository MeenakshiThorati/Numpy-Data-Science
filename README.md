This repository contains a python notebook that shows the basic functions of Numpy module.

->Getting familiar with numpy ,data manipulation mainly focuses on array indexing and slicing ,reshaping,and applying mathematical operations

->Data aggregation by using numpy functions to compute summary statistics like mean,median,Standard deviation,sum and also grouping data and performing aggregations

->Data analysis can be done using numpy to find correlations,identify outliers,and calculating percentiles.

->The advantages and Applications in Data Science are also highlightend.
